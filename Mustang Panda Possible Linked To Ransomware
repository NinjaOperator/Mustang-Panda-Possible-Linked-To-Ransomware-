Mustang Panda Possible Linked To Ransomware 
Part one 

On 11/23/20 ProofPoint  reported Mustang Panda is deploying PlugX payload written in Go. Reviewing the indicators I decided to focus on SHA256 930b7a798e3279b7460e30ce2f3a2deccbc252f3ca213cb022f5b7e6a25a0867 
 File Name: AdobelmdyU.exe 
Pivoted into Intezer to get a better undestanding of genetic makeup 930b7a798e3279b7460e30ce2f3a2deccbc252f3ca213cb022f5b7e6a25a0867. I noticed that this file shares 1,503 genes (97.85%) with  SHA256 a33856c79b6e10ce864cfece166b57c8c3f0e3f502a8d5c7b98084e25162871f
 File Name: activador office.exe. Intezer has categorized this file as Encrp Ransomware.
 
 Then Pivoting into VT and focusing on the Imphash and Rich PE header hash we can see that they share infrastructure.
 Imphash
fcf1390e9ce472c7270447fc5c61a0c1
Rich PE header hash
f933ea1f0c4bf584663810a9d16ff4f7

According to VT activador office.exe was created on 12/05/19 and AdobelmdyU.exe was created 3/26/2020.
Since the creation times for both files are current they are no indications that the developers utlized a technique called Timestomp (MITRE ID T1070).
So it's since the file have identical Imphash/Rich PE header hash it's likely that this threat activity is related and that the ransomware binary was created first.
However it's important to mention that there are no indications via OSINT (at this time) that Mustang Panda is deploying ransomware.

Due to the limited visibilty that I have using Freemium VT, Intezer and RiskIQ.  
I'll dive deeper in Part II by using other publicly available tools and OSINT and see if I can find additonal data that links Mustang Panda with Encrp Ransomware.
